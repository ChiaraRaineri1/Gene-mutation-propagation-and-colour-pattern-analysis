# Gene-mutation-propagation-and-colour-pattern-analysis
Numerical Methods in Engineering - course project (2023)
This project is divided in two parts.
In the first one we deal with the gene mutation propagation effect, using the Fisher model to describe it.
The second part is related to pattern formation on animal coats, described by using the Turing model.
